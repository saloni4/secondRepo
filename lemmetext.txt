battery avoltaic pile an device consisting of one or cellswith external provided to power electrical device such car when battery is power it positive terminal is it negative terminal is theanode the terminal marked negative is the source of electron that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device when battery is connected to an external circuit able to move a ion within allowing the chemical reaction to be completed at the separate terminal and so deliver energy to the external circuit it is the movement of those ion within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work the term battery referred to device composed of multiple cell however the usage ha evolved to include device composed of single cell primary single use or disposable battery are used once and discarded are changed during discharge common example are multitude of portable electronic device secondary be discharged and recharged multiple time using an applied electric current the original of the electrode can be restored by reverse current example include thelead acid in vehicle andlithium used for portable such battery come in many shape and size from miniature cell used to aidsand to small thin cell used to largelead acid in car and truck and at the largest extreme huge battery bank the size of room that provide standby or emergency power center according to estimate the worldwide battery industry generates sale each year with annual growth battery have much energy energy per unit mass than a gasoline in this is somewhat offset

to abattery of cannon benjamin franklin borrowed the term battery from the military which refers to weapon together italian voltabuilt and described the first battery thevoltaic pile in this wa stack of copper and zinc plate separated by brine soaked paper disk that could produce steady current for length of time volta did not understand that the voltage wa due to chemical reaction he thought that his cell were an source of energy and that the associated corrosion effect at the electrode were mere nuisance rather than an of their operation in although early battery were of great value for purpose in practice their voltage fluctuated and they could not provide large current for sustained period cell invented in by british frederic daniell wa the first practical source of becoming an industry standard and seeing widespread adoption a power source it consisted of copper pot filled with acopper in which wa immersed an filled acidand zinc electrode these wet cell used liquid which were prone to leakage and spillage if not handled correctly many used glass jar to hold their component which made them fragile and dangerous these made wet cell unsuitable for portable appliance near the end of the nineteenth century the invention ofdry cell battery which replaced the liquid with paste made portable electrical device practical principle of article voltaic cell for purpose in this example the two half cell are linked by asalt that permit the transfer of ion battery energy battery consists of some number ofvoltaic cell each cell consists of twohalf in series by one half cell includes and the negative electrode the electrode to negatively charged ion migrate the other half cell includes and the positive electrode to positively migrate power the battery cation are reduced electron are added at the cathode during charging while anion are oxidized electron are removed at the anode during charging during discharge the process is reversed the electrode do not touch each other but are connected by some cell use different for each half cell separator allows ion to flow between half cell but prevents mixing of the each half cell ha force emf determined by it ability to drive electric current from the interior to the exterior of the cell the net emf of the cell is the difference between the emf of it half cell thus if the electrode have mathcal mathcal then the net emf mathcal mathcal in other word the net emf is the difference between thehalf reaction the electrical driving force delta bat across cell is known a voltage difference and is measured involts the terminal voltage of cell that is neither charging nor is called theopen circuit voltageand equal the emf of the cell because of internal resistance the terminal voltage of cell that is is smaller in magnitude than the open circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of cell that is charging exceeds the open circuit voltage an ideal cell ha negligible internal resistance so it would maintain constant terminal voltage mathcal until exhausted then dropping to zero if such cell maintained volt and stored charge of on complete discharge it would perform work in actual cell the internal resistance increase under discharge and the open circuit voltage also decrease under discharge if the voltage and resistance are plotted against time the resulting graph typically are curve the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal employed across cell terminal depends on the energy release of the chemical reaction of it electrode and have different but the same emf of volt have different but the same emf of volt the high potential change in the reaction give lithium cell emf of volt or more category and type of article list of battery top to bottom large volt battery cell cell cell cell cell battery battery and pair ofbutton cell and battery are classified into primary and secondary form are designed to be used until exhausted of energy then discarded their chemical reaction are generally not reversible so they cannot be recharged when the supply of reactant in the battery is exhausted the battery stop producing current and is useless can be recharged that is they can have their chemical reaction reversed by currentto the cell this the original chemical reactant so they can be used recharged and used again multiple time some type of primary battery used for example were restored to operation by replacing the electrode secondary battery are not due to of the active material loss of and internal corrosion article primary battery orprimary cell can produce current on assembly these are most commonly used in portable device that have low current drain are used only or are used well away from an power source such a in alarm and circuit where other electric power is only available disposable primary cell cannot be reliably recharged since the chemical reaction are not easily reversible and active material may not return to their original form battery recommend against attempting to recharge primary cell in general these have battery but disposable battery do not fare well under high drain common type of disposable battery carbon battery article battery also known cell battery must be charged before first use they are usually assembled with active material in the discharged state battery are re charged by applying electric current which revers the chemical reaction that occur during discharge use device to supply the current are called charger the oldest form of battery is thelead acid battery which are widely used this technology contains liquid in an unsealed container requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of it produce during the lead acid battery is relatively heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply it low cost and it high surge current level make it common where it capacity over ah is more important than weight and handling issue common is the moderncar battery which can in general deliver peak current of the regulated lead acid battery battery is popular in the automotive industry a for the lead acid wet cell the battery us an reducing the chance of leakage and life battery immobilize the the two type are gel battery or gel cell use semi solid absorbed glass mat battery absorb the in special fiberglass matting other portable battery include several sealed dry cell type that are useful in such a mobile phone andlaptop computer cell of this type in order of densityand cost cadmium nickel zinc nickel metal hydride andlithium ion li ion cell li ion ha by far the highest share of the dry cell market ha replaced in most due to it higher capacity but remains in use inpower tool two way radio andmedical equipment in the include battery with embedded such which allows charging an battery through nanoball allow for discharge rate about greater than current battery andsmart with state of charge monitor and battery protection circuit that prevent damage on over discharge low self discharge allows secondary cell to be charged prior to shipping cell type of cell have been produced with varying chemical process and design cell cell fuel cell flow cellsand voltaic pile wet ha other name areflooded cell since the liquid cover all internal part orvented cell since gas produced during operation can escape to the air wet cell were precursor to dry cell and are commonly used a learning tool they can be built with common laboratory supply such asbeakers for of how cell work particular type of wet cell known a cellis important in wet cell may beprimary cell non cell originally all practical primary battery such a cellwere built a open top glass jar wet cell other primary wet cell are cell grove cell bunsen cell chromic acid cell clark cell cell the leclanche cell chemistry wa adapted to the first dry cell wet cell are still used in industry for standby power or power supply but in many place battery withgel cellshave been used instead these commonly use lead acid ornickel dry dry art drawing of dry cell brass cap plastic seal expansion space porous cardboard zinc can carbon rod chemical celluses paste with only enough moisture to allow current to flow unlike wet cell dry cell can operate in any without spilling a it contains no free liquid making it suitable for portable equipment by comparison the first wet cell were typically fragile glass container with lead rod hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage lead acid battery did not achieve the safety and of the dry cell until the of thegel battery common dry cell is thezinc carbon battery sometimes called the cell with nominal voltage of the same a battery since both use the samezinc manganese standard dry cell comprises azincanode usually in the form of pot with in the form of central rod the isammonium chloridein the form of paste next to the zinc anode the remaining space between the and carbon cathode is taken up by second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide the latter acting a in some design the ammonium chloride is replaced byzinc chloride molten salt primary or secondary battery that use molten salt a they operate at high and must be well insulated to retain heat batterycan be stored and supplying no power for long period perhaps year when the battery is needed then it is assembled by adding once assembled the battery is charged and ready to work for example battery for an electronic be activated by the impact of firing gun the break capsule of that activates the battery and power the fuze circuit reserve battery are usually designed for short service life second or minute after long storage year awater activated batteryfor or military becomes activated on immersion in water cell battery may vary over load cycle overcharge cycle and over lifetime due to many factor including internal chemistry and at low battery cannot deliver a much power a such in cold climate some car owner install battery warmer which are small electric heating pad that keep the car battery warm capacity and device to check battery battery the amount ofelectric chargeit can deliver at the rated voltage the more electrode material contained in the cell the greater it capacity small cell ha le capacity than larger cell with the same chemistry although they develop the same open circuit voltage capacity is measured in unit such asamp hour the rated capacity of battery is usually expressed a the product of hour multiplied by the current that new battery can supply for hour at while remaining above specified terminal voltage per cell for example battery rated at can deliver over hour period atroom the fraction of the stored charge that battery can deliver depends on multiple factor including battery chemistry the rate at which the charge is delivered current the required terminal voltage the storage period ambient and other factor the higher the discharge rate the lower the capacity the between current discharge time and capacity for lead acid battery is over typical range of current value law frac is the capacity when discharged at rate of amp is the current drawn from battery is the amount of time in hour that battery can sustain is constant around battery that are stored for long period or that are discharged at small fraction of the capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally consume charge carrier without producing current this phenomenon is known a internal self discharge further when battery are recharged additional side reaction can occur reducing capacity for subsequent discharge after enough recharges in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stop producing power internal energy loss and on the rate that ion pas through the cause vary above minimum threshold at low rate delivers more of the battery capacity than at higher rate installing battery with varying rating doe not affect device operation although it may affect the operation interval rated for specific voltage unless load limit are exceeded high drain load such asdigital camerascan reduce total capacity a happens with alkaline battery for example battery rated at for or hour discharge would not sustain current of for full two hour a it stated capacity implies also battery charger rate is measure of the rate at which battery is being charged or discharged it is defined a the current through the battery divided by the current draw under which the battery would deliver it nominal rated capacity in one hour discharge rate would deliver the battery rated capacity in hour discharge rate mean it will discharge twice a fast minute discharge rate on ah battery mean discharge current of rate would mean discharge current of standard for battery generally rate the capacity over hour hour or longer discharge time because of internal resistance loss and the chemical process inside the cell battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour type intended for special purpose such a in power supply may be rated by for discharge period much le than one hour the rate present error is in ampere hour and not ampere and one can not express current in ampere hour for this reason the concept itwas introduced by the standard itbeing equal to the capacity divided by one hour hence allowing correct method of current the figure used for expressing the discharge rate remain the same one can speak of itrate instead of the incorrect rate fast charging large and light of update lithium iron phosphate battery

and highest solar powered flight life and it synonym battery lifetime ha two meaning for battery but only one for non for it can mean either the length of time device can run on fully charged battery or the number of charge discharge cycle possible before the cell fail to operate for non these two life are equal since the cell last for only one cycle by definition the term shelf life is used to describe how long battery will retain it between and use available capacity of all battery drop with decreasing in contrast to most of today battery pile invented in offer very long service life without or recharge although it supply current only in the nanoamp range electric bellhas been ringing almost since on it original pair of battery thought to be zamboni pile self battery typically lose to percent of their original charge per year when stored at room this is known a the self discharge rate and is due to non current producing side chemical reaction that occur within the cell even when no load is applied the rate of side reaction is reduced for battery stored at lower although some can be damaged by freezing old battery self discharge more rapidly than disposable alkaline battery especially nickel based battery freshly charged nickel cadmium battery loses of it charge in the first hour and thereafter discharge at rate of about month however newerlow self discharge nickel metal hydride modern lithium design display lower self discharge rate but still higher than for primary battery part may corrode and fail or the active material may be slowly converted to inactive form physical component active material on the battery plate change chemical on each charge and discharge cycle active material may be lost due to physical change of volume further limiting the number of time the battery can be recharged most nickel based battery are partially discharged when purchased and must be charged before first use newer battery are ready to be used when purchased and have only discharge in year some occurs on each charge discharge cycle usually occurs because migrates away from the electrode or because active material detaches from the electrode low capacity battery can be charged some time whereas high capacity battery above last about cycle battery tend to be rated for cycle before their internal resistance increase beyond usable value charge discharge charging increase component change shortening battery lifespan charger cannot detect when the battery is fully charged then is likely damaging it memory also nickel cadmium battery memory cell if used in particular repetitive manner may show decrease in capacity called memory effect the effect can be avoided with simple practice cell although similar in chemistry suffer le from memory effect an analog camcorder lithium ion battery must endure stress due to vibration shock and range because of these stress their lead plate few automotive battery last beyond six year of regular use automotive starting starting lighting ignition battery have many thin plate to maximize current in general the thicker the plate the longer the life they are typically discharged only slightly before recharge deep cycle lead acid battery such a those used in electric golf cart have much thicker plate to extend longevity the main benefit of the lead acid battery is it low cost it main drawback are large size and weight for given capacity and voltage lead acid battery should never be discharged to below of their capacity because internal resistance will cause heat and damage when they are recharged deep cycle lead acid system often use low charge warning light or low charge power cut off switch to prevent the type of damage that will shorten the battery life life can be extended by storing the battery at low a in which slows the side reaction such storage can extend the life of alkaline battery by about battery can hold their charge much longer depending upon type to reach their maximum

circuit when battery is recharged at an excessive rate an explosive gas mixture be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery through built in vent leading to pressure build up and eventual bursting of the battery case in extreme case battery chemical may spray violently from the casing and cause injury that is attempting to charge battery beyond it electrical capacity can also lead to battery explosion in addition to leakage or damage it may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the battery is later used car battery are most likely to explode when short circuit generates very large current such battery which is very explosive when they are because the water in the during normal use the amount of is usually very small and generates little hydrogen which dissipates quickly however when jump starting car the high current can cause the rapid release of large volume of hydrogen which can be ignited by nearby spark when ajumper cable disposing of battery via may cause an explosion a steam build up within the sealed case recall of device using lithium ion battery have become more common in recent year this is in response to reported accident and failure ignition or explosion an expert summary of the problem indicates that this type us liquid to transport lithium ion between the anode and the cathode if battery cell is charged too quickly it can cause short circuit leading to explosion and fire damaged alkaline battery chemical are corrosive poisonous or both if leakage occurs either or through accident the chemical released may be dangerous for example disposable battery often use zinc can both a reactant and a the container to hold the other reagent if this kind of battery is over discharged the reagent can emerge through the cardboard and plastic that form the remainder of the container the active chemical leakage can then damage or disable the equipment that the battery power for this reason many electronic device

that could lead to safer faster charging longer lasting battery for handheld mobile device electric car and stationary energy storage more specific about the new technology were published in the peer reviewed scientific science review of the technology discus the risk of fire and explosion from lithium ion battery under certain condition because they use liquid the newly developed battery should be safer since it us glass that should eliminate short circuit the solid state battery is also said to have three time the energy density increasing it useful life in electric vehicle for example it should also be more sound since the technology us le expensive earth friendly material such a sodium extracted from seawater they also have much longer life the cell have more than cycle with low cell resistance the research and prototype are not expected to lead to viable product in the near future if ever according to chris robinson of research this will have no tangible effect on electric vehicle adoption in the next year if it doe at all key hurdle that many solid state face is lack of scalable and cost effective process he told the american energy news in an mail homemade any liquid
